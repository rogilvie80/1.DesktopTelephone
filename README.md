Simulation of a desktop telephone
What I did: 
•	Added meaningful behaviour to a provided GUI by providing keyboard, mouse and menu listeners/adaptors and registered their instances with the corresponding GUI elements.
•	Coded the required function of each button, eg ‘Dial’, ‘Load’, ‘Store’, ‘Reset’ etc.
